# Face-identification-using-Deep-Learning

A CNN based Deep Learning model with state-of-the-art ConvNeXt architecture for image classification and verification (face recognition) developed as an academic project for the course 11-785 Introduction to Deep Learning (Spring 2022) at CMU.

Trained the model on 175k images and achieved 86.1% accuracy and 0.96 AUC.

This academic project was conducted in form of a Kaggle competition where we were required to achieve certain minimum accuracy for the face identification task and minimum AUC for face verification task.
